# 2026-09-04 — VP-17766 booking-form email as consult recipient (To + CC)

## What happened
- Leo typed the ticket id after `/clear`. Atlassian MCP down all session; used the repo `.env`
  Jira REST credentials (same ones `scripts/reconcile-jira.py` uses) to read the ticket.
- Explored: transv2 code map (Explore agent), FE hunt across ~/src (Explore agent) → va-portal
  `ScheduleAMeetingDialog.vue`; prod read-only sizing found a SECOND ad-hoc multi-address row
  (36760, semicolon, truncated at 100 chars) besides 35082.
- Debate (pro/con agents) changed the design materially: con found the clinician-switch
  reschedule clones a new row with a hand-written field list, that every send guard tests the
  calendar column (would swallow the override), that the actual consult update/cancel paths are
  `*ToNonPatients`, and that the seeker is a loop not a singleton. All verified in code before
  adopting.
- Leo: approve A', no OTP, FE out of scope, backend first. Then "commit + push PR".
- Implementation followed Step 5 order: spec skeletons (pure util + input validation) before the
  service edits. eslint --fix reformatted untouched code; reverted those hunks to keep the diff
  reviewable.
- Full jest has 6 pre-existing failing suites on main (verified via stash baseline); recorded,
  not fixed.
- PR #617 → stage_test. Memory-repo push hook blocks any compound `cd ... && git push` to main;
  a bare `git push origin main` from the repo dir passes.

## Excluded / not done
- No prod data write (36760 fix, 35082 migration) — Leo has not answered Q4.
- No main PR yet (repo convention: stage_test PR first).
- No FE change.

## Leo's words
- "a ok 進step 5, 2. 不做 3. 不管FE, 先改code"
- "給我commit + push PR"

## Reusable
- Jira REST fallback when the MCP is down: `.env` JIRA_SERVER/JIRA_EMAIL/JIRA_API_TOKEN + curl
  `/rest/api/3/issue/{key}`; ADF description needs a small walker to flatten.
- transv2 schema changes: hand-written SQL in `prisma/manual-migrations/` + schema.prisma +
  `npx prisma generate`; GraphQL `Calendar` (calendar.model.ts) and `V2Calendar`
  (schedule.model.ts) `implements v2_calendar`, so every new v2_calendar column needs a @Field there.
- stash-baseline trick to prove failing suites are pre-existing: `git stash push -- src prisma`
  → run → `git stash pop`.
