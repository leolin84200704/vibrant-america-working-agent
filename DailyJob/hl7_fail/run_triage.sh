# HL7 File Input Daily Triage — $(date +%Y-%m-%d)

## BLOCKED — VPN down, prod DB unreachable

- Pre-flight: \`${DB_HOST}:3306\` unreachable from this machine at $(date).
- Likely cause: Cisco Secure Client VPN not connected (it auto-disconnects overnight) and the current network path cannot reach the DB without it.
- A headless reconnect to \`${VPN_SERVER}\` was attempted and did not restore connectivity (SSO login is interactive; the GUI agent holds the connect capability).
- **No DB queries were run. This is NOT a "no failed records" result** — re-run manually after reconnecting the VPN.
